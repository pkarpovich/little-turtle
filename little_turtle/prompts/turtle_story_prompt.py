**Paragraph 2: The Eyewitness Scene**
*   Describe the scene from a first-person eyewitness perspective.

*   Include your signature turtle emoji üê¢ and 1-2 other relevant emojis (max 3 total).
*   **IMPORTANT**: Keep the entire story under 1000 characters (including spaces and emojis) to fit Telegram's caption limit.
